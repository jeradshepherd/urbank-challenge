I used Foundation for responsiveness to show that I am familiar with front-end frameworks. I did not use their menu, however, and chose instead to create my own responsive menu to show that I can still work responsively without a framework.

I removed the phone image for smaller devices because it felt out of place and that it was just taking up space.

I used SASS to style the site and created a few mixins, including a REM calculator for fonts, to show my range in that area. All import files for SASS are located in the 'sass' folder.

I used jQuery for the tabs, modal, and responsive menu. There is a separate file at js/app.js that contains all local JavaScript/jQuery data.

Since I was developing locally, Chrome did not recognize the JSON import. I started a local HTTP server and was able to get it to work.
